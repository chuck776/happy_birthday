            <p>We're not on the best terms rn and things between us are a mess. I hope this doesn't come off creepy/like i'm a stalker</p>
            <p>As i'm writing this im thinking of what to say as to not make it weird.I want you to have this. i made this last night because it's your birthday today and i couldnt be there in person(i'm never able to be there in person) </p>
            <p> been hard to sleep recently because i know things are over between us,i'm not bitter anymore because i know what we had was real. and if in some distant place in the future,we see each other in our new lives,i'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent our short summer beneath the trees(disturbed by dogs),learning from each other and growing in love. The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us yearn for more.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Most Importantly,Lauren. i made this for you because i want you to have it. you don't have to read it though</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday Lauren Letoya Smears, regardless of what's going on in your life, i hope today was good and you atleast got to smoke like you said you would ,lol</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>I'm sorry things ended the way they did and i'm sorry i ended up being this horrible person to you towards the end.</p>
            <p>This isn't an apology(lol) or a justification of some sort. I just want you to have this because you mean alot to me and because you fuck w Elephants</p>
            <p>This is currently my most ultimate form of a 'back-of-the-phone' kinda letter <i class="fa-solid fa-gift"></i></p>
            <p> FROM ME, TO ONLY YOUUU</p>
            <p>Thank you Lauren, You were a wonderful experience</p>
