            <p>We're not on the best terms rn and things between us are a mess. I hope this doesn't come off creepy/like i'm a stalker</p>
            <p>As i'm writing this im thinking of what to say as to not make it weird.I want you to have this. i made this last night because it's your birthday today and i couldnt be there in person(i'm never able to be there in person) </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Most Importantly,Lauren. i made this for you because i want you to have it. you don't have to read it though</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday Lauren Letoya Smears, regardless of what's going on in your life, i hope today was good and you atleast got to smoke like you said you would ,lol</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>I'm sorry things ended the way they did and i'm sorry i ended up being this horrible person to you towards the end.</p>
            <p>This isn't an apology(lol) or a justification of some sort. I just want you to have this because you mean alot to me and because you fuck w Elephants</p>
            <p>This is currently my most ultimate form of a 'back-of-the-phone' kinda letter <i class="fa-solid fa-gift"></i></p>
            <p> FROM ME, TO ONLY YOUUU</p>
            <p>Thank you Lauren, You were a wonderful experience</p>
